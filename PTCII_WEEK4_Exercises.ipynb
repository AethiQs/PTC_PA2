    "### 6. In the previous questions you should have recognized that we are doing classification. In this question you will use a very simple classification model to see if you can predict whether `num` should be 0 or 1 for a patient based on the variables in `X`. First create a `LogisticRegression` transformer from SKlearn. Train this model on the **train** data using the `.fit()` method. We want you to figure the exact code out by yourself by looking at the example in the [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html). Don't worry about the hyperparameters for now and just use the defaults!"
